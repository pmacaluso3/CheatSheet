#U3.W8: Create a Cheat Sheet Pairing Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Use HTML5 tags to place content on a website
- Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page
- Illustrate fundamentals of web design and user experience in your website

## Summary:
At some point during Phase 0, you've probably wanted a handy cheat sheet that would have all the information you've ever wanted on a topic, in a simple form. Well, they do exist, but they aren't as good as the cheat sheet you can make! This is your chance to create a one-page cheat sheet on any Phase 0 topic. You can use these as references as you go through Dev Bootcamp!

Keep track of how much time you spend on this challenge.


## Release 0: Select a topic for a cheat sheet
 - Ruby BASICS
 - Ruby Enumerables
 - Ruby Hashes, Arrays, Strings, Integers
 - JavaScript Objects
 - JavaScript prototypes
 - Looping in Ruby and JavaScript (comparisons)
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - CSS Positioning
 - GIT
 - SQL
 - Your own awesome topic!

## Release 1: Wireframe
Create a wireframe for your cheat sheet. You can do it on paper or using a wireframing tool. Take an picture/screen shot of your wireframe and upload it into this directory.

## Release 2: Create a template
Create a new file in your github.io repository called `cheat-sheet.html`

Design your page with the idea that you and your cohort-mates are the clients. How would you want a cheat sheet to look to be effective as you go through Dev Bootcamp?

Consider the various ways you can present the information in HTML. HTML5 has officially become the new web standard, so use it. Make sure to follow best practices and reserve formatting for your CSS file!

## Release 3: Add content
Once your template is created, you'll need to add the information you want to present. You can copy and paste from any website or create your own.

## Release 4: Implement your design
Now that you have the HTML and content in your site, make it appealing using CSS (create a custom CSS file for this assignment). Have fun with it, but keep in mind it should also be an effective learning tool.

## Release 5: Publish
Link to your new cheat sheet from the index of your [USERNAME].github.io website.

## Release 6: Promote
Share your cheat sheet with others on Twitter using **#DBCCheatsheet**.

## Release 7: Compile (Optional)
It's great to have all these handy cheat sheets, but wouldn't it be even better to have them handy in one place for Phase 1? Compile your favorite cheat sheets into one website. What are the challenges that emerge from using different CSS stylesheets? Do you need to select one or can you use different sheets? Share the website with your fellow cohort-mates.
